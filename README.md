# CrateNinja
A fruit ninja like Unity game, made for fun in less than a day

# Install
Just download the latest installer in the release section, and execute it on your windows computer.
The first launch of the game may lead to a "Screen Smart" warning beacause I'm not a registred Windows developer. You can proceed by clicking "Advance settings".

The default 1080p resolution gives you the best HUD, the scaling for higher resolution is quit buggy.
